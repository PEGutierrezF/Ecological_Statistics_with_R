## Setting up your working directory
<br/>

### Check the Current Working Directory<br/>
To determine your current working directory, use the ``getwd()`` function. Type the following command in the R console and press Enter:
```{r}
getwd()
```
<br/>

### Choose a New Working Directory<br/>
Decide on a folder on your computer to set as your working directory. This folder will be where R looks for and saves files by default.<br/>
You can use the ``setwd()`` function. For example, to set your working directory to a folder named "my_project" on your desktop, run this command:
```{r, eval=F}
setwd ("C:/users/Pablo Guti/desktop/my_project/")
```
<br/>

### Choose a New Working Directory using RStudio Interface<br/>
Click on the **Session** menu at the top of the RStudio window.<br/>
Select **Set Working Directory**.<br/>
Choose **Choose Directory** to navigate to and select the folder you want as your new working directory.
